Welcome to Cloudy Brews! I am your host [Wade Wegner](/about/ "About"), an aspiring brew master and lover of good beer.

You know me. I’m like you. I love beer. I love brewing beer. But perhaps most importantly, I love sharing beer. This site is my way to share my journey brewing (and tasting) beer.

I’ve been brewing beer for nearly a year now. It’s a passion and a pursuit. I've learned a lot in this time but know that I have a lot more to learn. I plan to share with you all my triumphs and failures, my recipes, videos of the process, tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way, and everything in between. In addition to experimentation, I’ve learned a lot by reading books, videos, and blog posts created by others – consider this my gift back.

Brewing beer is simple and fun, and it's amazing at how good it can taste. Take a look below - you'll see a Dunkelweizen and Dry Irish Stout I made  within the first three months I was brewing. I've made some incredible beers that I've enjoyed drinking and shraing with others.

I hope you join me as I continue to learn about brewing and enjoy some good beers! Cheers!
